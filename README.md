# Lessons Learned
In this project I learned that Model is an interface that holds an objects data. I also learned that if I'm not showing a piece of data on a page I can use the hidden tag in HTML to ensure that the data is updated. I also learned the importance of using a sysout when troubleshooting to see where my problem is occuring. I didnt think that it would even print without a main but I learned that we can sysout in the Controller which really helped a lot. Also reading the errors in the console was a great help. Most of the time the console is telling exactly where the error is occuring.
